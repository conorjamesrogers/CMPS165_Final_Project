A JavaScript visualization of Houseplant care using D3v4 and Bootstrap. Uses D3's directed force graph to create a fun visual. 

We wanted to focus on a user-story that evoked one emotion: fun. The user can casually browse our selected houseplants and very quickly choose which would be the best suited based on: pet toxicity, plant size, and more. Most importantly, we wanted the user to have fun while finding the best plant, so we carefully crafted a user experience with direct feedback and cute animations + visuals.
